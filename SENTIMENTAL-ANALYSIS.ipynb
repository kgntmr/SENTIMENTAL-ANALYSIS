    "## SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS\n",
    "- I will perform sentiment analysis on data obtained from the Reddit API, specifically focusing on discussions related to homelessness in Ireland. The goal is to gain insights into the housing needs in the country.\n",
    "- For this analysis, I have chosen to utilize two libraries: TextBlob and NLTK. The inclusion of both libraries allows for a comparison of the results obtained through sentimental analysis. While TextBlob provides a simplified and user-friendly interface, NLTK offers greater flexibility and customization options.\n",
    "- The NLTK library, provides a comprehensive toolkit for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\n",
    "- NLTK provides finer control over tokenization and stemming, while TextBlob offers a straightforward and accessible solution primarily focused on sentiment analysis."
